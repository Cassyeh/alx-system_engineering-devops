# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

### **Issue Summary:**

**Duration:**
* Start Time: January 15, 2023, 02:30 AM (UTC)
* End Time: January 15, 2023, 06:45 AM (UTC)

**Impact:**
* The outage affected the availability of our primary web application, causing a 30% degradation in service performance.
* Users experienced slow page loads, intermittent errors, and a temporary inability to access critical features.

**Root Cause:**
* The root cause was identified as a database connection bottleneck due to a sudden spike in traffic during a marketing campaign.

### **Timeline:**

**Detection:**
* Detected at December 15, 2023, 02:30 AM (UTC) through automated monitoring alerts on elevated error rates and response times.

**Actions Taken:**
* Investigated backend systems to identify potential causes.
* Assumed a possible database overload and initiated scaling of database * resources.
* Examined network configurations and CDN settings for irregularities.
* Engaged the database team to review query performance and optimize heavy-load queries.

**Misleading Paths:**
* Initially assumed a DDoS attack due to the sudden traffic spike.
* Explored potential CDN misconfigurations that might affect content delivery.
* Investigated recent code deployments for possible introduction of bugs affecting database interactions.

**Escalation:**
* Escalated to the database team and network specialists after initial investigations did not yield conclusive results.

**Resolution:**
* Resolved the issue by increasing the database pool connections and optimizing critical queries.
* Implemented temporary rate limiting to mitigate excessive traffic until further optimizations were complete.
* Deployed a hotfix to address a minor code issue contributing to the bottleneck.

### **Root Cause and Resolution:**

**Root Cause:**
* The root cause was traced to a sudden increase in traffic, coupled with inefficient database queries that led to a connection bottleneck.

**Resolution:**
* Increased the database pool connections to handle higher concurrent requests.
* Optimized critical database queries to reduce execution times.
* Deployed a hotfix to address a code inefficiency impacting database interactions.

### **Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

**Improvements/Fixes:**
* Strengthen monitoring and alerting mechanisms for both traffic spikes and database performance metrics.
* Implement auto-scaling mechanisms for critical infrastructure components.
* Enhance disaster recovery strategies to quickly roll back deployments in case of unforeseen issues.

**Tasks:**
* Task: Implement automated scaling for database resources based on traffic patterns.
* Task: Conduct a comprehensive review of critical queries for optimization opportunities.
* Task: Enhance monitoring to include CDN configuration checks and alerting.
* Task: Conduct a post-incident review to identify areas for further improvement.

### **Conclusion:**

The web stack outage was a result of unforeseen traffic patterns overwhelming database resources. Swift detection, collaboration across teams, and targeted optimizations resolved the issue. Moving forward, implementing automated scaling, continuous query optimizations, and enhanced monitoring will fortify our infrastructure against similar incidents and improve overall system resilience.
